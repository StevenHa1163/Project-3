## Description

Have you ever felt like your favorite streamer was ignoring you? It’s not a good feeling, especially when you’ve been supping for the last 2 years and your voice is being drowned out by a bunch of plebs. No cap, we got the solution for you, TC or Twitch Comments. Whether your spamming “poggers” or “pepe plz”, your voice is sure to be heard in a new, separate feed for premiums scribers. 

* We would like usesrs to post comments
* We would  like if users can also edit and delete their posts.  
* We would like our users to have feedback on whether or not the streamer reads the post
